	App homology analysis tasks on binary codes are expected to be scalable and effective. However, most works have a complex training process or are slow and less capable of catching new increasing apps. We use two hierarchies' embedding model to obtain concise and accurate feature vector, which represents binary codes of the app. In our research, firstly, we implement a novel first-hierarchy embedding prototype for the CFG of app's binary codes called 5UD-CFG that preserves the global CFG structure. Secondly, we propose the compression, clustering and update algorithms according to the proposed second-hierarchy tensor embedding model to obtain a more concise and accurate feature numeric vector called 3TU-CFG for app's binary codes. This model abandons the complex learning process of existing effective works that are based on the neural network or other learning algorithms. Thirdly, Empirical experiments prove that the effectiveness of two hierarchies CFG embedding on app homology analysis detection. 3TU-CFG run $4\times$ to $76000\times$ faster than the existing works' preprocessing process and at least reduce the half of search time. At the same time, the homology detection accuracy approximates $99\%$.
